I have downloaded and installed MediaPipe via

'''pip install mediapipe'''


# So far, I have…

- applied facial detection and a face mesh
- applied hand detection and hand landmarks

# My first project was coded with the help of ChatGPT-4 & Claude. 

- I replaced camera feed with a black screen, but preserved the facial mesh and the hand landmarks.
- While my long term goal is to explore machine learning, and do something useful, I wanted to start with getting used to MediaPipe. 
- This could possibly be used for choreographing a music video, or I could use this for ‘anonymously’ embedding talking head footage into a different video.
- Can utilize machine learning, to recognize gestures/poses/etc.

# Endgame
- I used the lessons learned from this prototype to create a [music video for a client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxYISq7wdTc)
